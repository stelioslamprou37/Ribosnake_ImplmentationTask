task: >
  You have been given a mock 16S rRNA sequencing dataset consisting of forward (R1) reads from the casava‑18 paired‑end demultiplexed tutorial. 
  Using the provided workflow script, perform quality control, adapter trimming and ASV detection on the reads. 
  Answer the following questions based on the workflow results.

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: quality_control
    text: "What percentage of reads passed quality filtering for sample BAQ2420.1.1_8_L001?"
    answer_type: numeric_percent
    tolerance: 0.1

  - id: q2
    stage: trimming
    text: "How many reads remained in sample BAQ2420.1.1_8_L001 after adapter trimming?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: denoising
    text: "How many unique ASVs were detected in sample BAQ2420.1.1_8_L001?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q4
    stage: summarisation
    text: "Which sample had the highest number of reads after trimming?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q5
    stage: summarisation
    text: "How many samples in the entire dataset contained only a single read?"
    answer_type: integer_exact
